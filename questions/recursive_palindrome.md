#Recursive Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. e. g. "Nixon", "race car"

Please write a method to check if a given string palindrome.

PS. this is the problem to practice your recursion skill, you are welcome to solve in Ruby or JavaScript.

```Ruby
is_palindrome?("No X in Nixon")    # => True
```
