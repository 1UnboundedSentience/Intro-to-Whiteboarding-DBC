### Reverse Print a Linked List

<a href="https://gist.github.com/johnakers/da6e36ac6f1ecd590f89">Using the base code</a> provided, be able to print a linked list in reverse

##### Hint

You can reverse the list then make a print method but you don't have to. There are both iterative and recursive solutions.
