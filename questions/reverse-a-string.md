## Reverse a String

**Write a function to reverse a string in place.
"In place" means "without creating a new string in memory."**

Use a language where strings are mutable, like Ruby. In some languages, like Python, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they're created.

If you're not comfortable coding in a language with mutable strings, reverse an array of characters instead.
